title: Kinect-based system for automated control of terrestrial insect biobots
date: 2013-07-03 00:00:00 Z
abstract: Centimeter scale mobile biobots offer unique advantages in uncertain environments.
  Our previous experimentation has demonstrated neural stimulation techniques in order
  to control the motion of Madagascar hissing cockroaches. These trials relied on
  stimulation by a human operator using a remote control. We have developed a Kinect-based
  system for computer operated automatic control of cockroaches. Using image processing
  techniques and a radio transmitter, this platform both detects the position of the
  roach biobot and sends stimulation commands to an implanted microcontroller-based
  receiver. The work presented here enables repeatable experimentation and allows
  precise quantification of the line following capabilities of the roach biobot. This
  system will help refine our model for the stimulation response of the insect and
  improve our ability to direct them in increasingly dynamic situations.
