title: Acoustic Sensors for Biobotic Search and Rescue
date: 2014-11-01 00:00:00 Z
abstract: Advances in neural engineering have enabled direct control of insect locomotion.
  Insect biobots, with a natural ability to crawl through small spaces, offer unique
  advantages over traditional synthetic robots. A cyberphysical network of such biobots
  could prove useful for search and rescue applications in uncertain disaster environments.
  Our previous work has demonstrated control of Madagascar hissing cockroaches using
  a Kinect-based computer vision platform. We now demonstrate low-power insect-mounted
  acoustic sensors for future use in both environmental mapping and localization of
  trapped survivors. Our experimentation has shown the capability of an insect mounted
  array of microphones to localize a sound source.
