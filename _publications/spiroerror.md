abstract: 'Spirometry plays a critical role in characterizing and improving outcomes
  related to chronic lung disease. However, patient error in performing the spirometry
  maneuver, such as from coughing or taking multiple breaths, can lead to clinically
  misleading results. As a result, spirometry must take place under the supervision
  of a trained specialist who can identify and correct patient errors. To reduce the
  need for specialists to coach patients during spirometry, we demonstrate the ability
  to automatically detect four common patient errors. Creating separate machine learning
  classifiers for each error based on features derived from spirometry data, we were
  able to successfully label errors on spirometry maneuvers with an F1-score between
  0.85 and 0.92. Our work is a step toward reducing the need for trained individuals
  to administer spirometry tests by demonstrating the ability to automatically detect
  specific errors and provide appropriate patient feedback. This will increase the
  availability of spirometry, especially in low resource and telemedicine contexts.
