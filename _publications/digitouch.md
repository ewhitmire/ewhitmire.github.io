  It enables general input as well as text entry on head-mounted displays.
abstract: 'Input is a significant problem for wearable systems, particularly for head
  mounted virtual and augmented reality displays. Existing input techniques either
  lack expressive power or may not be socially acceptable. As an alternative, thumb-to-finger
  touches present a promising input mechanism that is subtle yet capable of complex
  interactions. We present DigiTouch, a reconfigurable glove-based input device that
  enables thumb-to-finger touch interaction by sensing continuous touch position and
  pressure. Our novel sensing technique improves the reliability of continuous touch
  tracking and estimating pressure on resistive fabric interfaces. We demonstrate
  DigiTouch''s utility by enabling a set of easily reachable and reconfigurable widgets
  such as buttons and sliders. Since DigiTouch senses continuous touch position, widget
  layouts can be customized according to user preferences and application needs. As
  an example of a real-world application of this reconfigurable input device, we examine
  a split-QWERTY keyboard layout mapped to the userâ€™s fingers. We evaluate DigiTouch
  for text entry using a multi-session study. With our continuous sensing method,
  users reliably learned to type and achieved a mean typing speed of 16.0 words per
  minute at the end of ten 20-minute sessions, an improvement over similar wearable
  touch systems.
